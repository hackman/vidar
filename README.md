Vidar is a tool for analyzing the IP and User-Agents of requests that hit your web servers.

The purpose of the system is to capture all user-agents and IPs and provide you with 
information, how many times a certain IP or user-agent has hit your servers.

Based on that information you can build a whitelist or blacklist of IPs and user-agents.
